# Code SI
The following is a code SI for "Rejection via Learning Density Ratios".

The python requirements can be found in the `environment.yml` file.

## Datasets
All dataset except those provided by `PyTorch` need to be downloaded. We have provided a script to be run in the root directory: `download_data.sh`.
For manual download, one can check the bash script.

## Running code
To run the code, we have a series of bash scripts to use.
Parameters (and their ranges) can be changed.
The current scripts only present a subset of the ranges used to make the plots.

```
bash clf.sh
bash baseline.sh
bash rej.sh
bash parse.sh
```

These, respectively, train the base classifier, train the density ratio rejectors, and evaluate and parse test set results.
